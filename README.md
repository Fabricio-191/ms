# @fabricio-191/ms

A copy of the famous [ms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms) with some changes, the main difference is that it supports Spanish
and the code inside is quite changed

I focused on it being used exactly like [ms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms)

Maybe later I will improve it by doing with multiple languages
and also improve the "Convert from Milliseconds" tool
